# Getting Started

Most importantly, remember to **go slowly and be methodical**. That means you
should be testing your changes in-browser as you write each line or so of code.
Always be commiting. Deploy early and often.

Here's a rough sketch of what you should do and in what order:

### Planning

1.  [x] Review [game-project-scope-study](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-scope-study)
1.  [x] User Stories
1.  [x] Review [project-planning-wireframes-practice](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/project-planning-wireframes-practice)
1.  [x] Wire Frames

### Set Up

1.  [x] [Download Browser Template](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/browser-template)
1.  [x] Create a Github Repository
1.  [x] [Deploy to Github Pages](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/gh-pages-deployment-guide)

### Game UI Round 1

1.  [x] Design a simple game board
1.  [x] Add a click handler for when a space on the game board is clicked
1.  [x] If the user clicks on a valid space then add their X or O
1.  [x] Do not allow users to add an X or O to an invalid space

### Game Engine

1.  [x] Create Empty Board in JS
1.  [x] Create a way to keep track of the current player
1.  [x] Add current player to your JavaScript representation of the board
    -  [x] Current player rotates between X and O
    -  [x] Can not choose already occupied spots
1.  [x] Check Board for Winner

### Game UI Round 2

1.  [x] Update the game engine when the game board is updated
1.  [x] Add messaging for the user when the turn changes
1.  [x] Add messaging for the user when the user clicks on an invalid space
1.  [x] Add messaging for the user when the game is over (win or draw)
1.  [x] Do not allow users to add an X or O to any spaces after the game is over

### Authentication

1.  [x] Review [api-token-auth](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/jquery-ajax-token-auth)
1.  [x] Sign Up (curl then web app)
1.  [x] Sign In (curl then web app)
1.  [x] Change Password (curl then web app)
1.  [x] Sign Out (curl then web page)
1.  [x] All API calls have success or failure messages

### Game API

1.  [ ] Review [jquery-ajax-crud](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/jquery-ajax-crud)
1.  [ ] Create Game, start new game (curl then web app)
1.  [ ] Update Game, play the game (curl then web app)
1.  [ ] Get Games (curl then web app)
