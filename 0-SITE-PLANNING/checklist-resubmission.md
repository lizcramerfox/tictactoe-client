Liz ,

We have determined that your first submission did not successfully complete all requirements for Project 1 for SEI.

The following requirements for successful completion were not met:


# Documentation

### Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
[] List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
[x] Link to wireframes and user stories.

# Technical Specifications
### Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select). Tip: Assume player X is the first player to start the game.
[x] Player X is not made first player at the start of every game, ex. If X went last, O will be first in the next game.

# Do Not

### Display non-functional buttons, nor buttons that do not successfully complete a task.
[x] After signout you can still click the View Records button and Start Game button which all give errors.

### Display errors or warnings in the console.
[x] You can start playing the game without clicking "New Game", which will cause errors in the console and not create the game on the API

### Display debugging messages in the console.
[x] Remove `console.log`s


We welcome a resubmission, to be evaluated by a consultant, due by Sunday, March 29th at 11:59 PM. Your graduation is contingent on this resubmission, as well as successful completion of future projects.

In order to resubmit your project, reply to this email with all project links by the deadline above.

Notes:
Grow: Missing feedback when the user clicks on the board in a spot that is already taken.
Glow: Nice work focusing on MVP! You got really far through this project.
Grow: Shows a number when you press get game records but what is that number?

Regards,

The SEI Team
